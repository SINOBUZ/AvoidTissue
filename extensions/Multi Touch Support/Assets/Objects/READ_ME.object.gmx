  multi_touch_click can be used in a variety of ways
  in a variety of situations.
  
  it is meant to be used for a mobile device.
  The code following execution of this script is only 
  run ONCE.  
  
  A version of the script to CONTINUOUSLY run code will
  enter development soon.
  
  That being said, if you have a project that entails 
  multiplayer on the same device, or if you're targeting
  a young demographic who cannot hold the device easily,
  or if you just want your player to be able to push multiple
  buttons at once, then this script will help you IMMENSLEY!
  
  It's great for begginers, as it still allows the use of
  drag and drop code, just like the built in event!
  
  For intermediate users, it creates a way to combine written code,
  WITH drag and drop that wasn't previously possible when implementing
  multi touch features!
  
  It's also a great time saver to the more experienced users,
  as it eliminates the need for coding each "virtual mouse" independantly,
  and DRASTICLY cuts down on the amount of code you have to write.
  As a bonus, it's very simple and can be easily edited to better suit your needs!
  
  We use this script in nearly every mobile game we create for it's sheer 
  versatillity and it's abillity to make our code much cleaner to read!
  
  We hope it makes a major impact within the community as a "goto" tool
  for mobile development, as well as making the transition 
  easier for new developers!  
  
  Thanks for helping us get our start in game development YoYo!
